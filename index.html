          <p>My project is addressing the low percentage of Latinx community involved in higher education
            by providing a website containing a
            variety of useful information. While some of the information may apply to
            a more generalized audience, the resources for building the website were curated with the Latinx
            community in focus. I chose to create a website to address the problem because as a Computer Science major,
            I want to tie in my roots and my community. Interweaving different parts of me into the project is a great
            opportunity to use some of what I have learned at Los Medanos College.</p>
