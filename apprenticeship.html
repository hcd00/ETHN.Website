        <p>Laney College has offers multiple Career and Technical Education programs.
          One advantage of being located in Oakland, CA. is being in the center of the ever evolving industries in the
          Bay Area.
          Their website says 'any high paying careers do not require a bachelor's degree but do require rigorous
          post-secondary education. There is in fact a growing shortage of skilled technical workers, and this
          shortage is increasing. These skilled technical jobs cannot be taken offshore or automated out.'
